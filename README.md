## Analyzing the Data About Almost 200 Electric Vehicles in the Data Set and Building a Little Dashboard Based on the Created Visualizations

Hi all!

In this project I take the data set from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedalishiha/electric-vehicles?resource=download. 

I describe the data and analyze it briefly. Then create a little dashboard based on the couple of visualizations.

To complete the project I'm using the following libraries:
* **pandas**;
* **seaborn**;
* **matplotlib**;
* **plotly**;
* and **dash**.

More details can be found in the _file_ itself :)
